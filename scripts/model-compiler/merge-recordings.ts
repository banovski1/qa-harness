/**
 * Fold what a human recorded into what the crawl found.
 *
 * A recording used to raise one number and contribute nothing else: the routes it
 * walked, the controls it touched and the endpoints it provoked went into a Markdown
 * file no tool read. So the second recording of an app cost exactly what the first one
 * did, for ever. This is the pass that makes a recording pay for itself.
 *
 * **Additive only, and the crawl always wins.** A recording proves that a human
 * addressed one element once. It does not prove — and cannot prove — that a second
 * element does not carry the same handle, which is the single thing the crawl exists to
 * establish. So a recorded control may fill a gap and may never replace a proof. Where
 * the two disagree the disagreement is counted in `stats` and the crawl's answer stands,
 * because a locator that silently became less certain between two compiles is a failure
 * nobody would look for.
 *
 * Pure: an analysis in, a new analysis out. No I/O, no clock, no ordering that depends
 * on anything but its input — which is what lets the whole of it sit under the snapshot
 * suite.
