/**
 * Pour a recording back into the analysis.
 *
 * This closes the loop the confidence score opens. `test-preconditions` refuses a
 * journey whose screens score below 0.7 and asks for a recording; before this existed
 * the recording was made, saved, and counted for nothing beyond a score bump — so the
 * second recording of an app cost what the first one did, and the framework never got
 * better at the app it was pointed at.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/analysis/ingest-recording.ts \
 *     recordings/apply-leave-20260913-100000.json
 *
 * It writes two sections and no others:
 *
 *   - `recordings`          the evidence: steps, routes, requests, exactly as observed
 *   - `testability`         the flow registered by name, and every screen rescored
 *
 * Everything derived from the evidence — new screens, new controls, new endpoints — is
 * the compiler's job, via `merge-recordings.ts`. This tool records what happened; it
 * concludes nothing. Run `npm run compile` afterwards and the loop is closed.
 *
 * This replaces `register-recording.ts`, which did the second half only. Two tools, one
 * registering a flow by name and one ingesting its content, would be two ways for the
 * file to be half up to date.
