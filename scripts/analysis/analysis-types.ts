/**
 * `analysis.json` — everything the four skills learn about one
 * application, in one file.
 *
 * There were eleven files and five reports here, and reviewing a change meant reading
 * a diff spread across all of them. One file with one section per skill is reviewable
 * by eye and loadable in one read by an agent, which is the same property from two
 * directions.
 *
 * Each skill owns exactly one top-level section and never writes another's. Nothing
 * merges sections implicitly: `write-section.ts` replaces one key and leaves the rest
 * byte-identical, so a re-run of one skill produces a diff scoped to its own work.
