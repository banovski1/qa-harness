# app-api

A UI test that creates its preconditions through the UI is slow and tests the wrong
thing twice. This file is what lets a spec set up state directly. Its other job is
**authentication**: the cheapest possible way to get a logged-in session.

Inputs: `.env`, and the `source` section written by app-dossier. Output: the `api` section of `analysis.json`.

## Work the tiers in order and stop when one pays

**Tier A — a specification exists, or can be produced.**

The mistake to avoid is searching for a *spec file*. A project that takes its API
seriously usually generates the spec instead of committing it, so the file is a build
artifact that does not exist in a fresh clone. **Absence of a spec file is not absence of
a spec.** Look for the spec's *source*, in this order:

1. **A committed spec** — `openapi.{json,yaml}`, `swagger.json`, `api-docs`, `.proto`, a
   GraphQL SDL file.
2. **A spec served at runtime** — a documentation route in the app's own routing
   (`/swagger`, `/api-docs`, `/openapi.json`, `/graphql`, `/redoc`). Reachable later even
   when nothing is committed.
3. **A spec generated from annotations in the source.** This is the common case in a
   mature codebase and the easiest to miss. Detect it by the *annotation marker*, not by
   the framework name — you will meet frameworks this file does not list:

   | ecosystem | marker to grep for |
   | --- | --- |
   | PHP | `@OA\\`, `#[OA\\`, `swagger-php`, `zircote`, `nelmio` |
   | Java/Kotlin | `@Operation`, `@Schema`, `springdoc`, `swagger-annotations` |
   | Python | `drf-spectacular`, `apispec`, `FastAPI` (its spec is automatic) |
   | .NET | `Swashbuckle`, `NSwag`, `[ProducesResponseType]` |
   | Go | `swaggo`, `// @Router` |
   | JS/TS | `zod-to-openapi`, `tsoa`, `@nestjs/swagger`, `fastify-swagger` |

   A generic sweep that outlives this table: grep case-insensitively for
   `open-?api`, `swagger`, `@OA`, `api-?doc` and `schema`, then read what the hits are.
   Match the hyphenated spellings too — a real project's command was
   `generate-open-api-doc`, which a search for `openapi` does not find.
4. **A command that produces one.** Check `package.json` scripts, `composer.json`,
   `Makefile`, `Rakefile`, `manage.py`, and above all **the CI workflows** — a project
   that lints its spec in CI has a spec, and the workflow names the exact command.

If the spec is generated and the toolchain is available, run the command and read the
result. If the toolchain is missing, **read the annotations directly** — they carry the
same schemas — and record `"tier": "A", "specStatus": "generated-not-run"` with the
command in `apiDocs.generateWith`, so a human with the toolchain can produce it in one
step. Never silently downgrade a generated spec to Tier B: an annotated codebase is a
documented API, and reporting it as undocumented is a false negative that costs far more
than an incomplete list.

**Tier B — the routes are declared.** Backend route tables and annotations:
Symfony `#[Route]`, Rails `config/routes.rb`, Laravel `routes/api.php`, Spring
`@RequestMapping`, Express/Fastify `app.get(...)`, Next.js `app/api/**/route.ts`, Django
`urls.py`, tRPC routers (each procedure is an endpoint, and its input schema is usually a
Zod object you can read the payload from).

**Tier C — the client calls them.** Grep the frontend for its HTTP layer (`axios`,
`fetch`, a generated client, a `Model.url` convention) and record the endpoints it calls.
Tier C is evidence that an endpoint is *used*, not that it exists as documented — mark
every Tier C row `"confidence": "observed-in-client"` and never present it as a contract.

Record the tier per endpoint. Mixing tiers is normal; hiding which tier a row came from
is not.

## Authentication — do this even if you skip everything else

Find, in order of usefulness:

1. **A token or API-key flow.** An endpoint that exchanges credentials for a token, and
   the header it goes in. Record the exact request shape.
2. **The session login endpoint.** The form POST target, the field names, the CSRF
   token's name and where it comes from, and what a success looks like (cookie name,
   redirect, 200 body).
3. **Roles.** If the app ships seed users or documents roles, record them — a test that
   needs an admin needs to know which user is one.

Never put a credential in this file. Reference `env:APP_USERNAME` / `env:APP_PASSWORD`.

### Then prove it — the auth block is not finished until the verifier passes

A login read out of source is a **hypothesis**, however good the citation. Every auth
block in this corpus was well-sourced and one of them was still wrong: the CSRF token a
form field calls `_token` was published on the page as an entity-encoded component prop,
so the documented flow could not have worked.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/api-auth/verify-auth.ts          # look
npx tsx scripts/api-auth/verify-auth.ts --write  # stamp the api section
```

It runs the login you recorded against the running instance, then calls a parameter-free
`GET` from your own `endpoints` list twice — once anonymously, once with the credential —
and only says `verified` when the endpoint **refuses the first and admits the second**. A
login that answers `200` proves nothing on its own; plenty of apps render their login page
with a `200`.

It needs `APP_USERNAME` / `APP_PASSWORD` in the environment and a reachable `baseUrl`.
Read the verdict as instructions:

| verdict | what it means | what you do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verified` | the credential opened a protected read | nothing — write `authVerification` and move on |
| `failed` | the flow ran and did not work | fix the auth block; the observations name the step that broke |
| `unverifiable` | no protected read to test against, or the spec names no scheme | say so in `notes`; do not claim the login works |
| `skipped` | no credentials in the environment, or the app declares no API login | say which, in `notes` |

**Rule: never hand-edit `authVerification`.** It is written by the verifier or it is
absent. An auth block with no `authVerification` is unproven, and any skill reading
the `api` section — `test-preconditions` above all — must treat it that way.

If the tool cannot express the app's flow, **fix the tool, not the app's entry**. It
knows token, Basic and form-session logins and no application names; a new shape belongs
in `strategies.ts` where the next app inherits it.

  "notes": [] }
```

Prefer the entities a test would actually need — the ones the UI creates — over
exhaustive coverage of an admin API nothing will call.

## Rules

- **Cite a file and line for every endpoint.** No citation, no row.
- **State the tier and the confidence.** A Tier C guess presented as a contract is worse
  than an omission, because it fails at 3am inside a precondition rather than in review.
- **Before concluding Tier A is empty, say where you looked.** An empty `spec` block must
  record the searches that came back nothing — the committed paths, the annotation markers,
  the CI workflows. "No spec" is a claim, and an unevidenced one is usually wrong.
- **This file is a reference, not a promise.** An endpoint here may still 403 for the
  test user. Say so in `notes` when you have reason to think it will.
- **Run the verifier before you report.** An `api.json` whose `auth` block has never been
  executed is a draft. `verified` is the only state that entitles a downstream skill to
  build a precondition on that login.

## Where this goes

One artifact per app. You own the `api` section of `analysis.json` and
write no other — write your JSON to a scratch file, then hand it over:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/analysis/write-section.ts --section api --file /tmp/api.json
```

The tool replaces that one key and leaves every other byte alone, so a re-run of this
skill produces a diff confined to your own work. Never edit `analysis.json` directly:
you would be rewriting three other skills' findings from whatever you happened to read.

## The contract

`analysis.json` has nine sections and always all nine. You own **`api`**
and write no other.

| section | owner |
| --- | --- |
| `app`, `source` | app-dossier |
| `conventions` | app-components |
| `api` | app-api |
| `map` | app-explorer (`map.mjs`) |
| `components`, `testability`, `stats` | compile-model.ts |
| `screens` | app-explorer (`explore.mjs`), enriched by compile-model.ts |

A section that is present but empty means its skill has not run, and `check-model.ts`
reports it by name. Leaving yours empty because you found nothing is a claim — say where
you looked in `notes` instead.
