# app-explorer

Turns a base URL and a login recipe into durable documentation of a running
application. No clone of the app's source is involved, and no framework is
assumed: the analyzer reads a rendered DOM and the traffic the app itself makes.

This is the browser-driven counterpart to `scripts/repo-analyzer`. Where that one
answers *what the source defines*, this one answers *what the running app
presents* — and it can prove a locator resolves to exactly one element, which
static analysis cannot.

## What it produces

For an app named `<app>`:

```
analysis/<app>/
  app-profile.yaml          the only app-specific file — you write this one
  screens/<Screen>.json     machine inventory: elements, ranked locators, regions
  crawl-state.json          visited / pending / failed, so a crawl resumes
  network.json              every XHR the app made, attributed to a screen
  openapi-discovery.json    what answered at the probed specification paths
  SCREEN-INVENTORY.md       every screen, its controls, its tables
  COMPONENT-ANALYSIS.md     regions that recur across screens vs. screen-specific ones
  LOCATOR-STRATEGY.md       the ladder, the tallies, and every weak locator by name
  API-DOCUMENTATION.md      observed endpoints, payload shapes, triggering screen
```

Everything except `app-profile.yaml` is generated. Never hand-edit it — re-run
the phase that wrote it.

## Two crawls, two questions

The deep crawl proves a locator for every control on every screen it can reach. It is thorough
and it is slow, and reaching a screen at all depends on that screen being linked by an `<a href>`.
Most business applications are not built that way: their modules hang off a menu, their submenus
open on a click, and half their screens have no inbound link anywhere in the DOM.

So there is a second, coarser crawl that navigates the way a person does.

```bash
node .claude/skills/app-explorer/lib/map.mjs --profile analysis/<app>/app-profile.yaml \
  [--only Leave,Time] [--budget-min 15] [--per-module-seconds 90] [--max-per-module 12]
```

It writes `app-map.yaml` (read by people) and `app-map.json` (read by tools): every module in the
primary menu, every entry in each module's own menu including the ones that only open a submenu,
and for each screen its heading, its buttons, its fields with their types, and its tables with
their columns. **Minutes, not hours** — the budget is enforced per module, and a module cut short
says so in `notes` rather than appearing thin for no stated reason.

**It never writes.** It follows menus and it reads screens. No button on a page is ever pressed —
only menu entries — so a map can be taken against an environment you care about.

The map is the coarse layer. The deep crawl sharpens the screens that matter, and a recorded
session sharpens them further still.

## Running it

```bash
# 1. open a browser session (the profile's `session:` names it)
playwright-cli -s=<session> open <baseUrl>

# 2. crawl — logs in, discovers routes, extracts screens, records traffic
node .claude/skills/app-explorer/lib/explore.mjs --profile analysis/<app>/app-profile.yaml

# 3. probe for a machine-readable API specification, using the logged-in session
node .claude/skills/app-explorer/lib/probe-openapi.mjs --profile analysis/<app>/app-profile.yaml

# 4. re-render the four reports (folds in whatever step 3 found)
node .claude/skills/app-explorer/lib/explore.mjs --profile analysis/<app>/app-profile.yaml --reports-only
```

Useful flags: `--resume` continues an interrupted crawl from `crawl-state.json`,
`--max-screens N` and `--batch-size N` override the profile's budget.

## Targeting a new app

Write a profile. Nothing else changes — no code in `lib/` knows about any
application.

```yaml
name: My App
baseUrl: https://app.example.com/
session: myapp

auth:
  loginUrl: https://app.example.com/login
  steps:
    - { action: fill, selector: "#username", value: "env:APP_USERNAME" }
    - { action: fill, selector: "#password", value: "env:APP_PASSWORD" }
    - { action: click, selector: "button[type=submit]" }
  readyWhen: "nav a[href='/dashboard']"

seedRoutes: ["/dashboard", "/customers", "/customers/new"]
exclude: ["/logout", "/admin/"]
budget: { maxScreens: 60, maxDepth: 2 }
settings:
  testIdAttribute: data-testid
  contentSelector: "#main"
```

A `value:` of `env:NAME` is read from the environment when the crawl runs, so a
credential never enters the profile or any artifact.

Two fields decide whether the crawl is stable, and both take a **visibly
rendered** element:

- `auth.readyWhen` proves the login worked. A zero-height container does not
  count as visible — pick something the user can actually see.
- `settings.contentSelector` proves the *application* finished rendering into the
  page. Settling proves the page stopped changing; without this gate a screen
  whose list has not arrived yet is recorded as a nearly empty one.

## What the map crawl learned the hard way

Each of these cost a wrong run, and each is now a comment in the code that explains itself:

- **A menu entry is not always a link or a button.** OrangeHRM's `Entitlements` is an `<li>` with
  a caret, and its children carry `href="#"` and navigate by script. Recognising only `a[href]`
  finds half a menu and none of its depth.
- **When a wrapper and a link share a name, keep the link.** The wrapper owns the popup, but only
  the link says where the entry goes. Preferring the outermost element turned every module into a
  click target with no URL, and the crawl became far more fragile for no gain.
- **A click that navigates has not navigated when it returns.** Reading the URL immediately
  reports the previous screen, so a real navigation looks like a dead menu item. Wait for the
  address to change — but only where a change is expected, since opening a dropdown correctly
  changes nothing.
- **A redirect destroys the execution context an evaluate is running in.** That is ordinary
  behaviour in an application that redirects after load. Retry it; do not record it as a broken
  screen.
- **`page.goto` throws when the page is already navigating.** Letting that exception escape
  abandoned the whole module and left the crawl recording the *previous* module's screen under the
  new module's name.
- **A module can hold the session.** OrangeHRM's Maintenance screen refuses to leave until a
  password is given, so the two modules after it were silently mapped as copies of it. Every
  module now starts from the home page, verifies it arrived, and re-checks *after* capturing —
  an application can let you arrive and then send you back.
- **The section test must be containment, not position.** `/pim/viewMyDetails` legitimately
  becomes `/pim/viewPersonalDetails/empNumber/7`. Comparing path positions rejects every screen
  whose URL carries a record id.
- **The run-code sandbox has no `URL` constructor.** Resolution belongs in the browser; origins
  are compared as text. This one cost two separate bugs, in two separate functions.
- **A shared batch budget starves the last module in the batch.** Time looked broken for three
  runs. It was simply last in line behind three large modules.

## How it stays stable

- **Settle on evidence, never on a timer.** In-flight requests drain, then the
  DOM mutation count must hold steady across consecutive samples. Then the
  content gate above. No `sleep` decides anything.
- **Generated ids are refused.** An id like `contact-edit-3598` is minted per
  render: stable within one crawl, different in the next. `looksGenerated` in
  `extract-screen.js` rejects those wherever a locator might anchor to one — this
  was the single largest source of run-to-run drift.
- **Failures are recorded, never skipped.** A screen that will not yield is
  retried once, then written to `crawl-state.json` with its reason and listed in
  `SCREEN-INVENTORY.md`. A missing screen is always visible.
- **Read-only.** The crawl navigates and reads. It opens create and edit screens
  because they are routes, but never activates a control, so nothing is saved,
  sent or deleted. Controls whose name matches the destructive pattern are
  flagged `destructive: true` in the JSON for whoever writes the tests.
- **Bounded and resumable.** `budget:` caps screens and depth; every batch writes
  state before the next begins.

## The locator ladder

`lib/rank-locators.js` defines the ranking, and it is the only place it exists —
the reports read it back from that file rather than keeping a copy. Best to
worst:

`testId` → `role` → `label` → `placeholder` → `scoped` → `attribute` → `text` → `css`

Every candidate is counted against the live DOM when it is built, so **unique
means one element answered to it on the rendered page**. The best *uniquely
resolving* candidate wins; a candidate matching several elements can never be
chosen.

`scoped` is the rung worth understanding: an expression anchored to an attribute
the application names on purpose — `[data-name="firstName"] input`. It is CSS, but
it breaks only when the field is renamed, so it counts as semantic. It is the
answer for a form-heavy app whose inputs carry no `for`-associated label.

A bare `css` path always resolves to one element, so it is never counted as a
semantic win. Those rows are listed by name in `LOCATOR-STRATEGY.md`: they are
the locators that will break first, and the controls worth fixing upstream.

## Using the output

`screens/*.json` is the contract; the markdown is its summary. Each element
carries `locator` (the chosen one), `candidates` (all of them, with match
counts), `unique`, `fragile`, `region`, `visible` and `destructive`. A framework
generator should read the JSON; a human should read the markdown.

Counts in the reports cover **visible** controls only. Hidden ones — collapsed
menus, closed dropdowns — stay in the JSON but are excluded from the totals,
because a locator for something nobody can see is not one a test can act on.

## Verifying a run

The claim this tool makes is reproducibility, so check it:

```bash
cp -r analysis/<app>/screens /tmp/runA
node .claude/skills/app-explorer/lib/explore.mjs --profile analysis/<app>/app-profile.yaml
# then diff the chosen locator of every visible element, per screen
```

On the EspoCRM demo this is 60 screens out of 60 identical. A screen that differs
is a finding: either genuinely live content, or a stability bug worth fixing here.
